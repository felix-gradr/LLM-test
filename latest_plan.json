  "Here are three bite-sized, high-impact tasks you can pick up next to shore up safety and prevent total failures:",
  "Wrap the `root.py` entry point in a top-level try/except that",
  "catches *all* exceptions,",
  "logs the full traceback to an `error_logger` module (and even auto-creates a stub if it doesn\u2019t exist),",
  "then hands control off to `fallback.py`\u2019s recover routine",
  "This guarantees that *any* crash in `root.py` gets captured and delegated to the fallback agent instead of killing the process",
  "Add a \u201cpre-flight\u201d syntax checker at the very start of `root.py` (before doing any imports or logic):",
  "iterate over every `.py` file in the repo,",
  "call Python\u2019s built-in `compile(source, filename, 'exec')` to surface SyntaxErrors early,",
  "if you find any syntax issues, log them and again invoke the fallback agent rather than proceeding",
  "This will catch misplaced `from __future__` lines or other typos before they bubble up",
  "Enhance `fallback.py` with automatic stub-generation for missing modules:",
  "when it sees a `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'X'` in an exception,",
  "create a minimal `X.py` in the repo root (or a dedicated `stubs/` folder) so future imports succeed,",
  "then retry the failed operation",
  "This prevents new, unexpected import errors from completely blocking progress"
