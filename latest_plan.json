  "Here are three bite-sized, high-impact tasks to move us forward on both long-term context-management and robust fall-back safeguards:",
  "Add \u201cdid-we-change-anything?\u201d guard + auto-fallback trigger",
  "\u2022 In `root.py`, at the very start, snapshot the repo\u2019s file-mod times (or a git hash)",
  "\u2022 After the main agent finishes its LLM tasks, re-snapshot and compare",
  "\u2022 If no meaningful change is detected, automatically invoke the fallback agent (e.g. call a `fallback.run()` function) and log that fallback was triggered",
  "Implement a change-summary logger",
  "\u2022 Create a new module `change_logger.py` with a function `summarize_changes(old_snap, new_snap)`",
  "\u2022 Use simple `diff` or file-mtime comparisons to produce a 2\u20133-sentence natural-language summary of what changed",
  "\u2022 Append that summary (with timestamp) to a `recent_changes.md` (or `CHANGELOG.md`)",
  "\u2022 Wire it into `root.py` just after the change-detector above",
  "Build a lightweight context manager for long-term memory",
  "\u2022 Create `context_manager.py` that:",
  "\u2013 Loads the last N entries of `recent_changes.md` (and/or a rolling summary)",
  "\u2013 Calls the LLM to consolidate into a concise \u201cproject-so-far\u201d paragraph",
  "\u2013 Emits `context_summary.txt`",
  "\u2022 Have your main loop include `context_summary.txt` (instead of raw code) in every new LLM prompt so the agent can plan with a longer horizon"
