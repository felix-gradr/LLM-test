  "Here are three bite-sized, high-impact tasks to shore up safety and avoid total \u201ccrashes\u201d going forward:",
  "Wrap the entire `root.py` entry\u2010point in a top\u2010level try/except that on *any* Exception automatically invokes your `fallback.py` agent instead of blowing up",
  "\u00ad\u2013 Ensures that if anything ever raises, you still make LLM\u2010driven progress",
  "Add a minimal `error_logger.py` stub in the repo (no `__future__` imports) that defines a \u201clog_exception(e: Exception)\u201d function",
  "\u00ad\u2013 Satisfies the missing\u2010module error and gives you a safe hook to capture any uncaught errors",
  "Create a tiny \u201clint\u201d utility (e.g. `fix_future_imports.py`) that scans every `.py` file for `from __future__` lines *not* in the first two lines, moves them to the top, and rewrites the file. Wire this into your startup so future\u2010import ordering errors never slip through again"
