Strengths  
1. Adds a focused, reusable utility (`tools.fs_find`) that can improve future code-navigation and is well documented.  
2. Implements sensible defaults: directory/extension filters, skip-dirs, content truncation, result limit.  
3. Unit tests cover filename match, content match and case-sensitivity; will safeguard basic behaviour.  
4. Maintains clean package structure (`tools/__init__.py`) and updates backlog, showing project organisation.

Weaknesses / Risks  
1. Regex vs substring fallback is implicit: if regex compilation fails, the pattern is coerced to lowercase but not escaped; user may be surprised by mixed semantics.  
2. Reading file content twice when include_content=True (once for matching, again for snippet) is redundant and slower.  
3. `_iter_files` filters by extension before inspecting content; binary files with a whitelisted extension (e.g. large .json) could still be loaded into memory risking performance.  
4. Uses `path.read_text(errors="ignore")` which silently drops decode errors and may yield misleading matches.  
5. Tests do not hit the regex branch, skip-dir logic, or max_results; edge cases untested.  
6. No explicit concurrency or cancellation support; large repos may block agent for long time.

Suggestions for improvement  
1. Always treat input as regex unless an explicit `literal=True` flag is provided; or expose separate `search_mode` to avoid silent fallback.  
2. Cache first file read so snippet reuse is free, or reuse content variable when include_content is requested.  
3. Add size limit guard (e.g., skip files >1 MB) and optionally use mmap/streaming search to handle large files safely.  
4. Provide decoding strategy: try utf-8, then chardet fallback, else skip; and surface unreadable files in a warning list.  
5. Expand test coverage: regex pattern, directory skipping, max_results, include_content truncation.  
6. Consider asynchronous iterator or thread pool for IO if repository scale becomes an issue.
