1. Strengths  
• Provides a well-documented, self-contained utility that will be handy for many developer workflows.  
• Reasonable safety measures: 2 MB read cap, binary-file heuristic, optional result cap.  
• Clear API with type hints and deterministic output ordering.  
• No external dependencies → suitable for constrained runtime.

2. Weaknesses / risks  
• Index mismatch risk: when case_sensitive=False the index is computed on lower-cased text (text_cmp) but the snippet is sliced from the original text; the start/end offsets may be wrong for non-ASCII or differing byte lengths.  
• No global early-exit when max_results is reached → continues walking the entire tree unnecessarily (performance on large repos).  
• os.walk scans everything; no filtering for .git, venv, node_modules, etc., which can make searches slow and noisy.  
• _TEXT_FILE_EXTS is small; many common textual extensions (.csv, .html, .css, .js, .ts, .ipynb) are omitted, leading to missed content matches.  
• Still reads up to 2 MB per file even if a hit is found early; could read less.  
• Potential UnicodeDecodeError edge cases despite errors='ignore' (rare but possible when slicing).  
• Unit tests / integration hooks not included, so regressions may slip by.

3. Suggestions for improvement  
• Recompute the snippet indices on original text (e.g., use regex with re.IGNORECASE to capture proper span) to avoid mismatch.  
• Break out of the outer loop once the combined hit count equals max_results.  
• Add an “ignore_patterns” / “exclude_dirs” parameter with sensible defaults (.git, venv, etc.).  
• Expand _TEXT_FILE_EXTS or switch to the binary-detection heuristic first, extension second.  
• Stop reading the file after the first match when include_content=False, or read in smaller chunks until a hit is found.  
• Provide basic unit tests for filename and content searches (case-sensitive and insensitive).
