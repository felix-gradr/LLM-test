1. Strengths  
• Clear, well-documented public API (`fs_find`) with sensible, easy-to-remember parameters.  
• Handles both path and content search, case sensitivity, extension filtering, max-result cut-off, and binary/decoding errors.  
• Returns JSON-serialisable list and provides contextual snippet for content matches.  
• Implementation is concise, readable, and avoids exposing unnecessary helper functions.

2. Weaknesses / Risks  
• Inconsistent docstring vs. behaviour: when `include_content=True` and the **path** alone matches, no snippet is added even though the docstring says “an additional key `snippet` is present”.  
• Result ordering depends on `Path.rglob`, which is OS/filesystem dependent; tests or downstream code might expect deterministic ordering.  
• Reads entire file into memory; large files could cause high RAM/latency.  
• No size/time guards when reading files; could hang on huge or special files.  
• Traverses every file under `root` (including `.git`, virtualenvs, etc.) unless caller filters; this may be slow on big repos.  
• Exceptions other than decode errors while reading (e.g., permission issues) are silently swallowed, making debugging harder.

3. Suggestions for improvement  
• Decide on snippet policy: either always add a snippet when `include_content=True`, or adjust the docstring to reflect current behaviour.  
• Sort the `results` list (e.g., alphabetically by path) for stable output.  
• Add a maximum file size (e.g., 1–2 MB) or a streaming read that stops after finding the first match to avoid loading huge files.  
• Optionally respect a default ignore set (`.git`, `__pycache__`, etc.) or allow caller to pass an ignore predicate.  
• Log (or at least count) skipped files due to read errors to aid diagnostics.
