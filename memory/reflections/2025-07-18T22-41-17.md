Strengths  
• Provides a handy, dependency-free search helper that could speed up prompt-time exploration of the repo.  
• Clear, thorough docstring with usage guidance and rationale; small public surface (only fs_find).  
• Type annotations, error handling for unreadable files, early stop via max_results, and case-insensitive option improve usability.  

Weaknesses / Risks  
• Reads whole files line-by-line without any hard size cap; very large text files can still cause high I/O and memory.  
• _iter_files() swallows all symlinks; may surprise if repo uses them.  
• No permission-error handling in _iter_files(); os.walk/rglob can raise exceptions that will bubble out.  
• Content search lower-cases every line each iteration—O(n²) in worst case; could pre-lowercase needle once (done) but still extra allocations.  
• Hidden/ignored directories (e.g., .git, venv) are not skipped, potentially slowing search and polluting results.  
• Newly added tool is not wired into any existing interface/tests, so dead code risk.  
• Lack of unit tests and README entry.  

Suggestions for improvement  
1. Add max_file_size parameter (e.g., default 1 MB) and skip bigger files to avoid runaway scans.  
2. Wrap _iter_files() in try/except PermissionError to keep search resilient.  
3. Allow exclude_dirs / ignore_patterns (default to .git, __pycache__, .venv, etc.).  
4. Consider yielding/generator interface to allow streaming results instead of building a list first.  
5. Add simple pytest covering path and content matches to guard against regressions.  
6. Document symlink behavior explicitly or add an option to follow them.
