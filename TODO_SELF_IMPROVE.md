# TODO â€“ SelfCoder Self-Improvement Roadmap

This file is automatically generated and will be refined over future iterations.

## High-Priority
1. Implement a modular agent architecture:
   - Planner: breaks down long-term GOAL into concrete tasks.
   - Coder: writes code changes for each task.
   - Tester: verifies changes and rolls back on failure.
2. Enhance fallback agent resiliency:
   - Detect execution errors and automatically revert last change if repository breaks.
   - Provide more informative diagnostics to aid recovery.

## Medium-Priority
1. Introduce unit tests for critical utilities (llm_utils, file I/O helpers).
2. Add a lightweight, file-based change history to track diffs across iterations.

## Low-Priority
1. Auto-generate documentation from docstrings.
2. Explore optional integration with external version control for auditability.

*This list will evolve as SelfCoder gains new capabilities.*
