- Here are three small, high-leverage tasks to get basic error‐logging wired in across the codebase:
- Create a central logger configuration
- • Add a new module (e.g. `error_logger.py`) that does something like:
- ```python
- import logging
- def get_logger(name=None):
- logger = logging.getLogger(name)
- if not logger.handlers:
- handler = logging.FileHandler("error.log", encoding="utf-8")
- fmt = logging.Formatter(
- "%(asctime)s %(levelname)-8s [%(name)s] %(message)s",
- datefmt="%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S",
- )
- handler.setFormatter(fmt)
- logger.addHandler(handler)
- logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
- return logger
- ```
- • This gives us one file (`error.log`) where everything winds up
- Wire it into `coder.py`
- • Import the central logger and replace the current `print_exc()` + silent failure with `logger.exception(...)`
- • Log both the task name and full stack trace on error. Also log “task succeeded” at INFO level
- • Example snippet inside `apply_task`:
- ```python
- from error_logger import get_logger
- logger = get_logger(__name__)
- try:
- exec(reply, {...})
- logger.info("apply_task succeeded: %s", task)
- except Exception:
- logger.exception("apply_task failed: %s", task)
- ```
- Wrap the top‐level entrypoints
- • In `root.py` (and likewise in `fallback.py`), surround the main orchestration with one big `try/except Exception as e:` block
- • On any uncaught error, do `logger = get_logger(__name__)` then `logger.exception("Uncaught error in main: %s", e)` before exiting
- • This guarantees *any* crash—LLM or Python—gets recorded to `error.log`

### 2025-07-19T14:32:04.173812+00:00
- Here are three small, high-impact tasks that will get us basic error logging in place without touching `goal.md` or `.env`.  Once these land, any downstream error (in your main loop, in `coder`, or in `fallback`) will at least be captured in a log file so we can iterate on a “current issues” dashboard later
- Add a simple centralized logger
- Create a new module (e.g. `root/logger.py`) that on import runs something like:
- ```python
- import logging, os
- os.makedirs("logs", exist_ok=True)
- logging.basicConfig(
- filename="logs/error.log",
- level=logging.INFO,
- format="%(asctime)s %(levelname)s %(name)s: %(message)s",
- )
- ```
- Export a `get_logger(name)` helper so any other module can do `logger = get_logger(__name__)`
- Instrument `root.py`’s main entrypoint with try/except
- In your `if __name__ == "__main__":` (or wherever the main loop lives),
- wrap the entire drive sequence in
- ```python
- from root.logger import get_logger
- logger = get_logger("root")
- try:
- main()   # whatever your startup function is
- except Exception:
- logger.exception("Unhandled exception in main loop")
- # Optionally re-raise or exit(1)
- ```
- This guarantees _any_ crash in root gets logged into `logs/error.log`
- Swap print/traceback in `coder.apply_task` for structured logging
- In `coder.py`, import `logging` (or your `get_logger`) instead of `print_exc()`, then inside the `except Exception as e:` block do:
- ```python
- logger = logging.getLogger("coder")
- logger.exception("Error applying task %r", task)
- ```
- That replaces the console‐only traceback with a persistent log entry
- Once these three bite‐sized changes are in place, rerunning `python -m root` will always drop any failures into `logs/error.log`, giving us a foothold to build out the “current issues” system next

### 2025-07-19T14:39:03.639998+00:00
- Here are three small, high‐impact tasks to steadily harden the startup path and guarantee that “python -m root” never silently dies:
- Create an `error_logger.py` helper
- – File: `error_logger.py` at repo root
- – Contents:
- • A `log_exception(exc: Exception)` function that writes a timestamped traceback to `errors.log`
- • Use standard library only (`traceback`, `datetime`)
- – Impact: central place to dump any uncaught exception for later triage
- Wrap and repair `root.py`’s startup
- – Move any `from __future__` lines to the very top of `root.py`
- – Surround the import of `error_logger` in a `try/except ImportError` so missing file doesn’t blow up
- – In the `if __name__=="__main__":` block, wrap the main run in `try/except Exception as e`, call `error_logger.log_exception(e)`, then always exit gracefully (e.g. print a one‐line status)
- – Impact: even if something else is broken, root.py will never explode unhandled
- Enhance `fallback.py` to auto‐capture and bootstrap fixes on startup errors
- – Import the `coder` module inside `fallback.py`
- – Instead of a straight `import root`, use `importlib` or a subprocess to catch `SyntaxError`, `ModuleNotFoundError`, etc
- – On any such failure:
- • Call `error_logger.log_exception(...)` to record it
- • Use `coder.record_task(...)` to append a “fix this startup exception” task to `pending_tasks.md`
- • Invoke `coder.apply_task(...)` so the agent immediately attempts an automated repair
- – Impact: fallback now not only logs, but proactively spins up an LLM‐driven fix and ensures we never get permanently stuck

### 2025-07-19T14:43:56.914111+00:00
- Here are three bite-sized, high-impact tasks to shore up safety and avoid total “crashes” going forward:
- Wrap the entire `root.py` entry‐point in a top‐level try/except that on *any* Exception automatically invokes your `fallback.py` agent instead of blowing up
- ­– Ensures that if anything ever raises, you still make LLM‐driven progress
- Add a minimal `error_logger.py` stub in the repo (no `__future__` imports) that defines a “log_exception(e: Exception)” function
- ­– Satisfies the missing‐module error and gives you a safe hook to capture any uncaught errors
- Create a tiny “lint” utility (e.g. `fix_future_imports.py`) that scans every `.py` file for `from __future__` lines *not* in the first two lines, moves them to the top, and rewrites the file. Wire this into your startup so future‐import ordering errors never slip through again

### 2025-07-19T14:49:24.793633+00:00
- Here are three bite-sized, high-impact tasks you can pick up next to shore up safety and prevent total failures:
- Wrap the `root.py` entry point in a top-level try/except that
- catches *all* exceptions,
- logs the full traceback to an `error_logger` module (and even auto-creates a stub if it doesn’t exist),
- then hands control off to `fallback.py`’s recover routine
- This guarantees that *any* crash in `root.py` gets captured and delegated to the fallback agent instead of killing the process
- Add a “pre-flight” syntax checker at the very start of `root.py` (before doing any imports or logic):
- iterate over every `.py` file in the repo,
- call Python’s built-in `compile(source, filename, 'exec')` to surface SyntaxErrors early,
- if you find any syntax issues, log them and again invoke the fallback agent rather than proceeding
- This will catch misplaced `from __future__` lines or other typos before they bubble up
- Enhance `fallback.py` with automatic stub-generation for missing modules:
- when it sees a `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'X'` in an exception,
- create a minimal `X.py` in the repo root (or a dedicated `stubs/` folder) so future imports succeed,
- then retry the failed operation
- This prevents new, unexpected import errors from completely blocking progress
