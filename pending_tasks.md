- [2025-07-19T14:12:18.118691] Here are three small, high-leverage tasks to unblock the system and guarantee “some intelligent progress’’ on every run:
- [2025-07-19T14:13:45.886245] Here are three immediate, high-leverage tasks you can pick up next. Each is small in scope but moves us sharply toward “never getting stuck” and “LLM-driven self-improvement.”
- [2025-07-19T14:15:06.603164] Here are three focused, high-leverage tasks to unlock forward momentum on both goals (never getting stuck + self-improvement):
- [2025-07-19T14:18:07.341441] Here are three concrete, high‐leverage tasks you can tackle next. Each is small in scope but unlocks key pieces of your orchestration and resilience story:
- [2025-07-19T14:20:23.369131] Here are three bite-sized, high-leverage tasks to unblock our loop and start building out our core orchestration:
- [2025-07-19T14:28:25.396488] Here are three small, high-leverage tasks to get basic error‐logging wired in across the codebase:
- [2025-07-19T14:31:24.365633] Here are three small, high-impact tasks that will get us basic error logging in place without touching `goal.md` or `.env`.  Once these land, any downstream error (in your main loop, in `coder`, or in `fallback`) will at least be captured in a log file so we can iterate on a “current issues” dashboard later
- [2025-07-19T14:37:32.824002] Here are three small, high‐impact tasks to steadily harden the startup path and guarantee that “python -m root” never silently dies:
