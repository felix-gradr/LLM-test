- [2025-07-19T14:12:18.118691] Here are three small, high-leverage tasks to unblock the system and guarantee “some intelligent progress’’ on every run:
- [2025-07-19T14:13:45.886245] Here are three immediate, high-leverage tasks you can pick up next. Each is small in scope but moves us sharply toward “never getting stuck” and “LLM-driven self-improvement.”
- [2025-07-19T14:15:06.603164] Here are three focused, high-leverage tasks to unlock forward momentum on both goals (never getting stuck + self-improvement):
- [2025-07-19T14:18:07.341441] Here are three concrete, high‐leverage tasks you can tackle next. Each is small in scope but unlocks key pieces of your orchestration and resilience story:
- [2025-07-19T14:20:23.369131] Here are three bite-sized, high-leverage tasks to unblock our loop and start building out our core orchestration:
- [2025-07-19T14:28:25.396488] Here are three small, high-leverage tasks to get basic error‐logging wired in across the codebase:
- [2025-07-19T14:31:24.365633] Here are three small, high-impact tasks that will get us basic error logging in place without touching `goal.md` or `.env`.  Once these land, any downstream error (in your main loop, in `coder`, or in `fallback`) will at least be captured in a log file so we can iterate on a “current issues” dashboard later
- [2025-07-19T14:37:32.824002] Here are three small, high‐impact tasks to steadily harden the startup path and guarantee that “python -m root” never silently dies:
- [2025-07-19T14:42:59.849731] Here are three bite-sized, high-impact tasks to shore up safety and avoid total “crashes” going forward:
- [2025-07-19T14:48:34.198388] Here are three bite-sized, high-impact tasks you can pick up next to shore up safety and prevent total failures:
- [2025-07-19T14:53:15.980772] Here are three small, high-leverage chores that will substantially harden your system and guard against complete failure:
- [2025-07-19T14:56:16.461749] Here are three small, high-impact tasks to get us unstuck and driving continuous progress:
- [2025-07-19T15:21:57.366876] Here are three small, high-leverage tasks you can tackle next to drive the system forward:
- [2025-07-19T15:25:45.676773] Here are three bite-sized, high-impact tasks that will kick-start your long-term strategy and enforce “no repeats” by logging exactly what changed each run:
- [2025-07-19T15:43:53.041255] Here are three small, high‐impact tasks that directly target “cleaning up junk” and “curating the LLM context window.”  Each one can be implemented in isolation, yet together they will (a) keep your repo tidy, (b) keep your LLM inputs lean, and (c) automatically remove the one‐time seed.txt on first run
- [2025-07-19T15:45:05.444132] Here are three bite-sized, high-impact tasks to move us toward “curating the context window” and “cleaning up junk.” Each is self-contained and can be picked up by the coder agent immediately:
- [2025-07-19T15:51:30.862055] Enhance the _cleanup_junk() function to recursively delete __pycache__ directories and .pyc files
