# High-Level Roadmap

Creating a sustainable SaaS with ≥ $1,000 MRR will be tackled in phased, iterative sprints. Each phase has clear exit criteria so we can reevaluate assumptions before committing more effort.

| Phase | Timeframe (rough) | Key Objectives | Exit Criteria |
|-------|------------------|----------------|---------------|
| 0 – Infrastructure & Planning | Week 1-2 | • Bootstrap repository & automation<br>• Write roadmap & idea backlog<br>• Select tools, cloud accounts | • CI pipeline runs lint/tests on every commit<br>• Roadmap & candidate idea list complete |
| 1 – Research & Validation | Week 2-4 | • Market research (TAM, competition)<br>• Customer interviews & surveys<br>• Score ideas, pick 1-2 to prototype | • Chosen idea validated by ≥ 5 qualified prospects who express willingness to pay |
| 2 – MVP Build | Week 4-8 | • Architect minimal lovable product<br>• Implement core backend, simple UI<br>• Integrate billing & auth | • Deployed MVP used by at least 3 external beta testers |
| 3 – Launch & Early Marketing | Week 8-10 | • Public launch (Product Hunt, subreddit, etc.)<br>• Iterate based on feedback<br>• Add onboarding & docs | • ≥ 20 active users, first paying customer |
| 4 – Monetization & Scaling | Week 10-14+ | • Refine pricing tiers, add usage-based metrics<br>• Harden infra (monitoring, backups)<br>• Establish acquisition channels (SEO, content, partnerships) | • ≥ $1,000 MRR sustained for 2 consecutive months |

This roadmap is deliberately aggressive but achievable by focusing on one narrowly-scoped, high-value pain point.
