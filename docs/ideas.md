# Candidate SaaS Ideas (v1)

Below is a quick-and-dirty backlog. Each idea includes an initial TAM estimate, visible competition, and why we might win. **Nothing is committed yet.**

| # | Idea / One-liner | Target Customers | Rough TAM / Pricing | Competition | Differentiator |
|---|-----------------|------------------|---------------------|-------------|----------------|
| 1 | AI Meeting Notes → Action Items | Remote tech teams | ~5 M teams • $20-100/mo | tl;dv, Fireflies | Focus on **actionability** (Jira/GH integration) not generic notes |
| 2 | Compliance Doc Generator for FinTech Startups | Seed-Series B fintechs in US/EU | ~6k companies • $200-500/mo | Vanta, Secureframe | Narrow scope → cheaper; lightning-fast SOC 2 gap reports |
| 3 | Automated Changelog & Release Notes from Git Logs | Dev-tooling teams | All software orgs • $10-50/mo | git-changelog-tools, ReleaseNote.ai | Better formatting, multi-channel push (email, Slack, in-app) |
| 4 | Browser-based Spreadsheet Stress-Test (load-test formulas) | Finance analysts | ?? niche • $30-100/mo | None obvious | Unique tech, quick MVP |
| 5 | Personalised Prospect Briefs for B2B Sales (AI) | SMB sales teams | Huge • $49/mo/seat | Clay, Cognism | Live briefing docs auto-generated before calls |

Next step: Score using a rubric (pain severity, buy urgency, dev cost, marketing edge) and interview 3-5 prospects per top idea.
