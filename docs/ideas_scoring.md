# SaaS Idea Scoring – 2025-07-18

To narrow our focus we scored each candidate idea on four dimensions.  A simple
weighted formula highlights which concepts balance **customer pain** with
feasible **time-to-value** for a solo builder aiming for ~$1k MRR.

Scoring rubric
• Pain severity – "How badly does the target user feel this today?" (1-5, wt = 2)
• Buy urgency  – "How quickly will they pay for relief?" (1-5, wt = 2)
• Dev cost     – "How fast/cheap can *we* ship an MVP?" (1-5, low cost ⇒ high score, wt = 1)
• Differentiation – "Can we stand out vs. incumbents?" (1-5, wt = 1)

Total = Pain×2 + Urgency×2 + DevCost + Diff.

| # | Idea | Pain | Urgency | Dev Cost | Diff | Weighted Total |
|---|------|------|---------|----------|------|----------------|
| 1 | AI Meeting Notes → Action Items | 3 | 3 | 4 | 2 | **18** |
| 2 | Compliance Doc Generator (FinTech) | 5 | 5 | 2 | 3 | **25** |
| 3 | Automated Changelog & Release Notes | 4 | 4 | 5 | 3 | **24** |
| 4 | Spreadsheet Stress-Test Tool | 2 | 2 | 3 | 4 | **15** |
| 5 | Personalised Prospect Briefs | 3 | 3 | 4 | 2 | **18** |

Observations
• Idea #2 tops the chart thanks to *severe regulatory pain* and *budget* in
  FinTech.  Drawback: higher domain expertise, trust requirements, and longer
  sales cycle.
• Idea #3 places a very close second but scores the *highest* on **dev speed**.
  The tech is straightforward (git parsing, summarisation, delivery channels),
  letting us ship & iterate quickly.
• Ideas #1 and #5 are crowded spaces with only moderate pain; #4 is niche.

Decision
Given our goal of reaching **$1k MRR rapidly with minimal upfront effort**, we
will pursue **Idea #3 – Automated Changelog & Release Notes**.  It balances a
real developer pain point with a build scope suitable for a one-person team.

Next actions (Phase 1 – Validation)
1. Draft problem / solution statement & feature shortlist.
2. Prepare 5-question interview script; schedule calls with eng. leads / PMs.
3. Spin up a teaser landing page with email capture & "early-access" CTA.
