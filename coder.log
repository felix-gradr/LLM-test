2025-07-19T14:31:37.736625 | Here are three small, high-impact tasks that will get us basic error logging in place without touching `goal.md` or `.env`.  Once these land, any downstream error (in your main loop, in `coder`, or in `fallback`) will at least be captured in a log file so we can iterate on a “current issues” dashboard later -> error: name '__file__' is not defined
